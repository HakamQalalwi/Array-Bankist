# Array-Bankist
Banking web application with only front-end.
# Introduction
The goal of this project was to practice using array methods, numbers & dates, timers, & the Internationalization API. I additionally practiced making a flowchart using the draw.io application.
# Login
There are many accounts to log in to. The first lowercase letter for account's username like is "js" with the password "1111". The second has username "stw" with password "3333". Once logged in, you can transfer money back and forth between the two accounts. However, you will notice a 1:1 exchange rate despite a difference in currency. There is no logout button; log in to the other account while still logged into the current. You can also request a loan and close the account altogether. If the loan is approved, the approved amount will appear in the transaction history after a brief delay. Lastly, there is a logout timer to log you out after inactivity.
